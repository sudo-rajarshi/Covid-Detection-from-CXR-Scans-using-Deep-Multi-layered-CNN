# Covid-Detection-from-CXR-Scans-using-Deep-Multi-layered-CNN

This is a multiclass classification of different disease related to Chest X-Ray like-
1. Severe Acute Respiratiory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19
2. Pneumonia
3. Normal Condition.

Using advanced image processing and deep learning algorithms the results of the classification are-
1. Training Accuracy = 99.5 (±0.001) %
2. Validation Accuracy = 97.6 (±0.011)%
3. Test Accuracy = 99.1%

4. Sensitivity = 98.8 %
5. Specificity = 99.4%
